# Todo-Application


For the login credentials use email:test@rapptrlabs.com and password:Test123.

While creating this application I referenced previous projects of mine, stackoverflow and blogs.

For the login component I took approximately 4 hours. I hit a roadblock when creating the POST request, because I originally used 'application/json' for the header, but needed 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'. Another roadblock was session persistence. I had previously created databases for my applications so was not familiar with this feature. I used the package 'react-session-persist' to impliment this.

For the todo-list component I took approximately 3 hours. This component was not difficult but was time-consuming, because it has multiple features such as add, delete, edit, and a filter feature.
